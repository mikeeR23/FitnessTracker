# FitnessTracker
This Android App allows you to track your macros to ensure you're reaching your diet goals. It also allows you to enter in the number of sets/reps/weight while you're at the gym so you can keep track of how much volume you're lifting every week. Once entered, it will show progress changes made on a week-by-week basis.

Testing: add &#96 code &#96
